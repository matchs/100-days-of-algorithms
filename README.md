# 100-days-of-algorithms

Inspired by [100 days of algorithms](https://medium.com/100-days-of-algorithms) by Tomáš Bouda
and the [100DaysOfCode](http://100daysofcode.com/) I decided to join in with [@AndersonQ](https://github.com/AndersonQ/100-days-of-algorithms) and [@belimawr](https://github.com/belimawr/100-days-of-algorithms) and code something not work related for 100 ~ 150 days in a row.

## Rules

* Code at least every two days
* Inputs must come from `stdin` and output on `stdout`
* Unit tests, 100% of code coverage
